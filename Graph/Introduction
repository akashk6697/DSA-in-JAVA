Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges.
 The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). The graph is denoted by G(V, E).

 Basic Operations on Graphs:
Below are the basic operations on the graph:

Insertion of Nodes/Edges in the graph – Insert a node into the graph.
Deletion of Nodes/Edges in the graph – Delete a node from the graph.
Searching on Graphs – Search an entity in the graph.
Traversal of Graphs – Traversing all the nodes in the graph.

Representation of Graph Data Structure:
There are two ways to store a graph:

Adjacency Matrix
Adjacency List

  Connected Component: We can find all connected components in an undirected graph.
  Topological sorting: BFS can be used to find a topological ordering of the nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).



    Depth First Search or DFS for a Graph

    DFS use stack for implementation
