String representation in java
 There are four ways to declare string in java.
1. String s = "Akash";
    String s1 = new String("GeeksforGeeks"); 
2.  char []arr = {'A','K','A','S','H'};

3. StringBuffer class
      StringBuffer str = new StringBuffer("Akash");
4. StringBuilder class
       StringBuilder str1 = new StringBuilder("GeeksforGeeks");
