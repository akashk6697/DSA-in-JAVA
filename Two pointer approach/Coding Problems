Two pointer approach ----- There are two pointers used in these problems


pair of elements (A[i], A[j]) such that their sum is equal to X.
Find the closest pair from two sorted arrays
Find the pair in array whose sum is closest to x
Find all triplets with zero sum
Find a triplet that sum to a given value
Find a triplet such that sum of two equals to third element
Find four elements that sum to a given value


Floydâ€™s Cycle Finding Algorithm ---- this algorithm uses two pointer 

Detect cycle or loop in linked list
find length of loop
remove loop or cycle in linked list
